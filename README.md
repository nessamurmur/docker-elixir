## What is Elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

To learn more about Elixir, check the [getting started guide](http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started) or [the official website](http://elixir-lang.org/).
